# Contributing to the Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! We welcome contributions from everyone who is interested in improving our project.

## How to Contribute

To contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your changes.
4. Make your changes and commit them with clear and concise commit messages.
5. Push your changes to your forked repository.
6. Submit a pull request to the main repository.

## Code Style

Before making changes to the main branch, please follow first our code style. I typically follow the [TypeScript style guide](https://ts.dev/style/) and the [clean-code-typescript](https://github.com/labs42io/clean-code-typescript) repository as the guide is comprehensive but not overburdening, easy to read and pretty good.

## Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
